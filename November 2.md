# Design notebook for week ending November 2, 2014

## Description

I scoped out my project --- namely, I think it would be best to start with the
smallest scope, that of family relationships only, only one (parent-child)
command available to the user to define said relationships.  I also did the
project description and plan.

I still need to pin down the syntax and output format.

## Questions

**What is the most pressing issue for your project? What design decision do
you need to make, what implementation issue are you trying to solve, or how
are you evaluating your design and implementation?**

I need to decide whether I ever want a user-defined relationship functionality
or a UI.  Both (especially user-defined relationships) are major things that I
should design around from the start, although both will start as stretch goals.

**What questions do you have for your critique partners? How can they best help
you?**

Is my scope too small?

**How much time did you spend on the project this week? If you're working in a
team, how did you share the labor?**

No team, just me. :(

I spent about three hours, mostly throwing ideas around for DSLs and dismissing
them.  The actual writup took about an hour.
